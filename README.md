#### Problem 1: The Birthday Presents Party
Several things could have gone wrong, depending on how the servants handled
accessing the gift chain.
* When adding a new present to the chain, a servant could have accidentally attached
the chain to a present another servant is in the midst of removing, losing the presents
past that point!
* When removing a present, another servant could have tried to add a present after the
removed present, losing that present they just added!
These are just a few examples; even more could have gone wrong
